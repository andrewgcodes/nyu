          My involvement in Hack Club started when I began a coding club at my

          . In September 2017, the nonprofit hired me to redesign their website,
          and I subsequently joined the team. Working 20+ hours a week during
          both the last school year and this one, I designed a new brand
          identity, a new application system, engineered the{' '}

          high schools around the world.

          After working (remotely) at Hack Club for the better part of a year, I
          moved to San Francisco for five weeks in the summer of 2018 to{' '}
          <H>intern at their headquarters full-time</H>. There, I designed and
          built new products, including{' '}
